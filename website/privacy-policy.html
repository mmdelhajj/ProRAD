            <p>ProxRad Mobile App</p>
            <p>Effective Date: February 28, 2026</p>
        </header>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                ProxRad ("we", "our", or "us") operates the ProxRad mobile application (the "App").
                This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles information when you use it to connect
                to and manage your self-hosted ProxPanel ISP management server.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are committed to protecting your privacy. The App is designed as a management interface
                that connects to your own server -- we do not operate a centralized service that collects
                or stores your data.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>How the App Works</h2>
            <p>
                ProxRad is a mobile client for ProxPanel, a self-hosted ISP management platform. The App
                allows ISP administrators and resellers to manage subscribers, monitor bandwidth, view
                dashboards, and perform administrative tasks by connecting to their own ProxPanel server
                instance.
            </p>
            <p>
                The server URL is configured by you, either by scanning a QR code or entering it manually.
                All communication occurs directly between the App on your device and your own server.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Information Stored on Your Device</h2>
            <p>The App stores a minimal amount of information locally on your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Server URL</strong> -- the address of your ProxPanel server, so the App knows where to connect.</li>
                <li><strong>Authentication token</strong> -- a session token received after login, used to keep you signed in.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This information is stored only on your device and is not transmitted to ProxRad or any third party.
                You can remove this data at any time by logging out or uninstalling the App.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Information Accessed Through Your Server</h2>
            <p>
                When you use the App, it communicates with your self-hosted ProxPanel server to display and
                manage data such as subscriber accounts, bandwidth usage, service plans, and other ISP
                management information.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of this data resides on your own server infrastructure. ProxRad does not have access to,
                collect, or store any of this data. You are responsible for the security and privacy of data
                on your own server.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Data Collection</h2>
            <p>
                The App does not collect personal data. We do not collect usage statistics, device information,
                location data, or any other personal information. The App requires internet permission solely
                to communicate with your configured ProxPanel server.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>
                The App does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
                No data is shared with third parties. The only network communication the App performs is
                with the server URL that you configure.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>
                We take reasonable measures to protect the information stored on your device. The authentication
                token is stored in the device's secure storage. We recommend that you use HTTPS when configuring
                your server URL to ensure that communication between the App and your server is encrypted.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                The App is not designed for or directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly
                collect any information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe
                your child has provided information through the App, please contact us at
                <a href="mailto:support@proxrad.com">support@proxrad.com</a> so we can take appropriate action.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>
                We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page
                with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
